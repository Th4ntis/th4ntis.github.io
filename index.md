I'm Th4ntis, a cyber security and information security enthusiast. I enjoy the world of Cyber Security and Information Security as a career and a hobby. I'm a professional penetration tester who specializes in wireless hacking, my background also includes network penetration testing. I have my PNPT, CRTP, and I enjoy tinkering with electronics and sharing my knowledge to others via my blog(walkthroughs, guides, and how-to's) and my gitbook(brain dump) of CyberSec notes. Feel free to reach out with questions, comments, requests, etc. from any of my socials at the bottom of the page.
