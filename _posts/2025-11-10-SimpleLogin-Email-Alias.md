[SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) is a service to make multiple email aliases. An email alias is an email address that when it receives an email, it will be forwarded to your real email. This means you can create a different email to use for a service, like Facebook or Netflix, that when the alias email is sent an email, it will be forwarded to your real email.

**NOTE:** This may not work on ALL services. Some services will not let you use an alias. This will work on most though.

This is helpful for multiple reasons. You have the ability to turn on/off an email at will. So you can turn off an email that you get a bunch of spam from, but can turn it back on if you need to purchase something from the website again.

It also is great to keep your real personal email private from companies that sell your data or if a company gets breached(hacked), the hackers won't have your real email address.

This comes with 2 options: Free, and Paid. With a free account, you get 10 alias. So you can make 10 alias that will forward to your real email.
Example: Make one email for social media, one for online shopping, one for random things that require you have an email with, etc.

They also have a paid version ($36/yr) that I recommend if possible that way you can make any as many alias you want. I personally use this one so I can have an individual alias for each account. Much easier to manage and turn off spam.

# Starting
This is very simple and painless, I promise.

To start, I recommend making a new email account. This is s you can have a fresh email address clean from any spam and junk mail. I use and recommend [ProtonMail](https://mail.proton.me/) but you can also [Googles gmail](https://mail.google.com/mail).

[Sign up with SimpleLogin](https://app.simplelogin.io/auth/register) with your new (or existing if you didn't make a new one) email address. One logged in and you verify your email, you'll be taken to the SimpleLogin Dashboard. From here you can create, enable or disable email alias.

# Using
From here I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the SimpleLogin extension for your browser:
- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/simplelogin-by-proton-sec/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn?pli=1)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simplelogin/)
- [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simplelogin-for-safari/id6475835429?mt=12)
- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/simpleloginreceive-sen/diacfpipniklenphgljfkmhinphjlfff)

On the dashboard, if you are making one alias for multiple services, click the "+ New Custom Alias" button in the top left.

From here, choose an alias name change your domain. You may be limited depending on if you are using the free or paid account. For example, if using the free account and you want an email for online shopping, you can name it "shopping". Then click create.

Going back to your dashboard, you should see the alias you just created along with the default one created by SimpleLogin. You can delete the one from SimpleLogin.

From here, either sign up to online shopping like Amazon or Etsy with your new alias, OR log into your existing account on the service and change your email to the alias.

# Using the Add-On/Extension
If you have the premium version or want to use the Add-On/Extension, you can quickly and easily make alias. On the website you want to make an alias for, Netflix in my example, click the icon for the Add-On/Extension. This will auto fill the website name into the field and let you know you are going to create a new alias.

You can click create, and following you can click the email to copy it to paste it where needed.

From the Add-On/Extension, you can also toggle on/off alias to stop/start getting emails sent to that alias.

Ta-da! You're all set! You can easily stop getting spam now by signing up for junk services with a junk alias, and keep your real, personal, email address hidden and safe!
